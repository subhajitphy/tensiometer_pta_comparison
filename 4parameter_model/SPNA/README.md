We are comparing the PSR J1713 data corresponding to SPNA noise runs between [EPTA & EPTA+INPTA](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12_P9AaMpE6STG-9sr9vpqHmltiuiZ5rZ). 
Two models has been considered: 
* Â **Model A** : we have considered 2 parameters: $[ \log_{10 }A_R, \gamma_R]$., where subsscript "R" indicates red noise and obtain the tension $(\Delta_A)$
* **Model B** : we incorporate 4 parameters: $[ \log_{10 }A_R, \gamma_R,\log_{10 }A_\text{DM}, \gamma_\{DM}]$ and calculate the tension $(\Delta_B)$ with this.

We finally acquire 
```math

\Delta_A=0.02 \sigma, \Delta_B=0.01 \sigma.


```
